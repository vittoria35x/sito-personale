# Curatorial Philosophy

This archive is built on clarity, continuity, and respect for the craft. Marble is not a material that allows shortcuts: it requires time, precision, and a certain discipline of gesture. The intention of this space is to preserve that discipline and present it without excess.

Each piece is part of a sequence. The numbering is not a system of classification, but a way to acknowledge the passage of time and the evolution of the work. Every sculpture carries its own moment, and together they form a quiet narrative of continuity.

The philosophy behind this archive is simple: to offer an honest view of a craft rooted in Carrara, without commercial language or decorative storytelling. The focus remains on the material, the gesture, and the slow rhythm that defines this tradition.
