Work Sheets

Each sculpture in this archive has its own sheet, presenting the essential information of the piece: number, material, dimensions, and a brief note on the gesture or intention behind it. The purpose is clarity. Nothing superfluous, nothing decorative.

The numbering follows a continuous sequence. When a piece is acquired, its sheet remains part of the archive, and the next sculpture continues the progression. This allows visitors to follow the evolution of the work over time.

These sheets are not technical documents. They are small curator notes: a way to frame each piece within the larger narrative of the archive, where matter, gesture, and continuity define the identity of the work.
