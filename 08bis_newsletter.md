# Newsletter

This newsletter is a simple way to share updates about the archive: new numbered pieces, reflections on the craft, and small notes from the work in Carrara. The rhythm is slow and intentional, following the natural pace of creation.

Subscribers receive only essential information. No promotions, no noise. Just a clear view of how the archive evolves over time and how each new sculpture fits into the ongoing sequence.

The purpose is continuity: to keep a quiet, direct connection with those who appreciate the craft and its narrative.
