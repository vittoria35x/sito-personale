# Notes on Legitimacy

This archive is presented with full respect for the origin of the material and the tradition it belongs to. All marble used for the sculptures comes from authorized sources in Carrara, following local regulations and established practices of extraction.

Each piece is carved by hand, using methods consistent with the craft of this territory. The intention is to maintain transparency about the process, the provenance of the material, and the continuity of the work.

These notes serve as a simple reference for visitors who wish to understand the ethical and material foundations of the archive. Nothing more, nothing less: clarity, respect, and coherence with the tradition of Carrara.
