# Resonance and Feedback

This section collects reflections, impressions, and responses from visitors who encounter the archive. The intention is not to measure approval, but to understand how each piece resonates with different sensitivities and cultures.

Marble carries a long history, and every sculpture can evoke something unique: a memory, a gesture, a sense of clarity. These notes help trace how the works travel through the world and how the narrative of the archive expands beyond the physical pieces.

Feedback is presented in an essential form, without ratings or evaluations. It is simply a way to observe the dialogue between the works and the people who experience them.
