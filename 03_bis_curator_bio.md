# Curator Bio

I work in Carrara, a place where marble has shaped both the landscape and the people who live in it. My approach is simple: to preserve the clarity of the gesture, the dignity of manual work, and the continuity of a tradition that still speaks through matter.

Each small sculpture is carved by hand and numbered in sequence. This archive is not built for quantity, but for coherence. The intention is to present a clean, honest view of a craft that belongs to this territory and its long history.

My role as curator is to select, document, and transmit these pieces with precision. Every work is a fragment of a larger narrative: the relationship between marble, time, and the human gesture.
