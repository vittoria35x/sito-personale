# Introduction to Carrara

Carrara is a place where marble is not just a material, but a cultural identity. For centuries, this territory has shaped a unique relationship between landscape, craft, and human gesture. The quarries, the dust, the light on the mountains, and the sound of tools form an environment where creation is both physical and contemplative.

This archive presents a selection of small marble works, each carved by hand and numbered in sequence. They are not industrial objects. They are fragments of a long tradition, interpreted through a contemporary, essential approach.

The intention is simple: to offer a clear, honest view of a craft that still carries the weight of history and the dignity of manual precision. Carrara remains a place where matter and thought meet, and where each piece is a small act of continuity.
