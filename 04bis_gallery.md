# Gallery

This gallery presents a selection of small marble works, each carved by hand in Carrara and numbered in sequence. The pieces are shown in their essential form, without excess, so that the focus remains on the gesture, the material, and the continuity of the craft.

Every sculpture belongs to a living archive. New numbers appear over time, following the natural rhythm of the work. When a piece is acquired, its number remains part of the sequence, and the next sculpture continues the progression.

The gallery is designed to be clear and linear: a space where visitors can observe the pieces, understand their origin, and follow the evolution of the archive through its numbered works.
