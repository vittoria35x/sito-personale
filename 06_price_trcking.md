 Price Tracking

Each sculpture in this archive includes a clear and transparent price, based on the time of work, the material, and the continuity of the craft. The intention is to offer visitors a simple and honest reference, without commercial pressure or promotional language.

Prices may evolve over time as the archive grows and new pieces are added. When a sculpture is acquired, its number remains part of the sequence, and the next work continues the progression with its own updated value.

This section allows visitors to follow the development of the archive through its numbered pieces, understanding how each work fits into the broader rhythm of creation.
